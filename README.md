Face-Recognition-Using-dlib-PIL(Steps)

Step 1 : Face Detection(There can be multiple people in the image. So 1st Step corresponds to detcting all the faces in an image).

Step 2 : Face Landmark Detection(This corresponds to finding the face landmarks like the eyes, nose, lips, etc). Aligning faces if faces are rotated a little sideways and then detecting the landmarks.

Step 3 : Face Encoding(Encoding the different landmarks of the face). This will help us calculating the similarity between two faces.

Step 4 : Face recognition(Finding whether the image we are seeing is of a person we know or is authorized). Final step of recognising the face.

Step 5 : Application of Face recognition(Finding the most similar person, or drawing eyelashes,etc)
